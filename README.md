# Quadratic Sieve (QS)

This is a very simple implementation of the Quadratic Sieve. It is part of my seminar in cryptology on the topic of RSA. Therefore it shall only demonstrate the general functionality of the Quadratic Sieve and is deliberately not optimized. The functionality matches the method described in the corresponding presentation and report that I created for this seminar.
